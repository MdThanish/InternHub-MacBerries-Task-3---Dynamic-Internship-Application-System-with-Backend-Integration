- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap, Animate.css)
- JavaScript
- PHP
- MySQL (for database operations)

### How to Use ‚ÑπÔ∏è

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a MySQL database and update the database credentials in PHP files (`insert.php`, `fetch_all_records.php`, `delete_record.php`).
3. Open the project in a web browser and fill out the internship joining form.
4. Submit the form to apply for the internship.
5. Use the provided contact information for any inquiries or assistance.

### Backend Connection üîå

The InternHub project is integrated with a backend system to handle database operations and ensure data persistence. The backend connection is established using PHP and MySQL, enabling seamless interaction between the frontend form and the database.

#### Database Setup

Ensure you have set up a MySQL database to store internship application records. Update the database credentials in the PHP files (`insert.php`, `fetch_all_records.php`, `delete_record.php`) to establish a connection with your database server.

#### Insertion of Data

When a user submits the internship joining form, the PHP script (`insert.php`) processes the form data and inserts it into the database. It handles parameter binding, data validation, and insertion queries to securely store user information.

#### Fetching Records

The PHP script (`fetch_all_records.php`) fetches all records from the database and returns them as JSON data. This data is used to display either a single inserted record or all records based on user selection in the frontend.

#### Deletion of Records

The PHP script (`delete_record.php`) handles the deletion of records from the database. It receives the record ID to be deleted, constructs a SQL query to remove the record, and executes the query to update the database accordingly.
